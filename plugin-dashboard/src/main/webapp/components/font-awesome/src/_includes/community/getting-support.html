    I don't have time to answer Font Awesome support emails anymore. So here are some things you might wanna do:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>

      It's been updated recently to make Font Awesome even easier to use.
    </li>

      Font Awesome</a> over on Stack Overflow. Other folks might have had the same question you've had.
    </li>
