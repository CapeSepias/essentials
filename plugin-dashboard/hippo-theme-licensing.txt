The plugin-dashboard sources and assembled WAR contain a copy/fork of the Hippo Theme.
This fork is present under src/main/webapp/components/**. Due to absent of incompatible
licensing, the following two components are skipped/removed:

  - js-detect-ie (licensing unclear)
  - html5shiv (GPL2)

They are not used by Essentials. When updaing to a newer version of the Hippo Theme,
make sure you remove these components from all distributions.
